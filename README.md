# Transforming_data_S3
In this project, in case if we have multiple applications uses the same S3 dataset, each app/service require to access specefic part of the data, so transforming data is essenthial.

In this tutorial we have S3 bucket which has transaction credit card data, and we need to extract only the refund transaction from S3 bucket.

# The steps to achive the goal:

*1: S3 bucket 
*2: Add a sample of the data as a file to the S3 bucket 
*3: Create an S3 access point 
*4: Create a Lambda function 
*5: Configure an IAM policy for your Lambda function's execution role 
"*"6: Create an S3 Object Lambda Access Point 
"*"7: View the transformed data
